-- Owner-written member instructions (docs/member-instructions.md). An owner may give a member
-- instructions when it spawns it. Like the member's engine and profile they never change, so
-- every launch of every conversation of the member gives the model the same text.
--
-- Locks on existing tables, held until migrate() commits: SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE on members for the
-- new foreign key, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on audit_events to replace its type CHECK (dropped and
-- re-added NOT VALID, so no row is scanned) and to build one empty partial unique index, which
-- reads audit_events once. As in 025 and 026 they are taken together with NOWAIT and retried, so
-- the migration never waits in a lock queue and never joins a deadlock. A native turn's admission
-- transaction holds only ACCESS SHARE on members, which this mode allows, and nothing on
-- audit_events, so a running turn never delays it. After 60 s without the locks it fails with
-- 55P03 and applies nothing.
