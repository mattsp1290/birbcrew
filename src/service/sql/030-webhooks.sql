-- Outbound webhooks (docs/webhooks.md). An owner registers HTTPS endpoints; the gateway's
-- dispatcher (src/service/webhooks.ts) reads committed audit rows after a cursor, records one
-- delivery per endpoint and event in an outbox, and posts a small signed body to each.
--
-- Locks on existing tables, held until migrate() commits: ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on audit_events to drop
-- NOT NULL from member_id (webhook rows belong to no member), add a member CHECK and replace the
-- type CHECK (both NOT VALID, so no row is scanned), and SHARE for two empty partial unique index
-- builds, which read audit_events once each. No other existing table is locked. As in 025 the lock
-- is taken with NOWAIT and retried, so the migration never waits in a lock queue, where every
-- audited write would queue behind it. After 60 s without the lock it fails with 55P03 and
-- applies nothing.
