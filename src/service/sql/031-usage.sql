-- Usage metering (docs/usage-metering.md): one ledger row per native launch whose SDK returned a
-- result, with the token counts it reported, and an optional per-member token budget that
-- request admission enforces.
--
-- Locks on existing tables, held until migrate() commits: SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE on members and
-- native_launches for the new foreign keys; ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on audit_events to replace its type
-- CHECK (dropped and re-added NOT VALID, so no row is scanned) and to build two empty partial
-- unique indexes, which read audit_events once; ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on routine_firings to replace
-- its reason CHECK the same way. As in 025 they are taken together with NOWAIT and retried, so
-- the migration never waits in a lock queue and never joins a deadlock. A native turn's
-- admission transaction holds ACCESS SHARE and ROW SHARE (FOR SHARE) only, which these modes
-- allow, so a running turn never delays it. After 60 s without the locks it fails with 55P03
-- and applies nothing.
